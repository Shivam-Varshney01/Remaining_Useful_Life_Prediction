# Remaining_Useful_Life_Prediction

Rolling bearings are critical components in the safe and reliable operation of electric vehicles (EVs), and predicting their remaining useful life (RUL) is essential for minimizing the risk of failure and optimizing maintenance schedules. This project aims to develop a computational model that utilizes various machine learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), continuous wavelet transform (CWT), and support vector machines (SVM) to predict the RUL of rolling bearings in EVs accurately.
